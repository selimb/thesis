\section{Syn3D}
\label{sec:resultssyn}
Verification of the implementation of the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model in Syn3D is verified in this section. First, the program is compared against established CFD codes on three different cases available on the Turbulence Modeling Resource (TMR) website~\cite{tmr}. Then, it is compared against experimental data on an RAE2822 airfoil. Finally, results for a multi-element airfoil configuration are shown.
